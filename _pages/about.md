Hi, I’m Minggang (pronounced “ming-gahng”; you can also call me Martin) Li 🎓 — a UC Berkeley rising sophomore double-majoring in Applied Mathematics and Data Science, with a Computer Science minor. I’m passionate about building machine-learning solutions that tackle real-world challenges, from forecasting crypto markets to creating AI-powered tools for social impact. 

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me running, perfecting my matcha rituals, or exploring photography. I also love reading Japanese mystery novels—especially Haruki Murakami (_The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle_; _The Wild Sheep Chase_) and Keigo Higashino (_Journey Under the Midnight Sun_).
