Hi, Iâ€™m Minggang (Martin) Li ðŸŽ“ â€” a UC Berkeley rising sophomore double-majoring in Applied Mathematics and Data Science, with a Computer Science minor. Iâ€™m passionate about building machine-learning solutions that tackle real-world challenges, from forecasting crypto markets to creating AI-powered tools for social impact. 

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me running, perfecting my matcha rituals, or exploring photography.
