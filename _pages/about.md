Hi, I'm Minggang (Martin) Li — a UC Berkeley undergrad studying Applied Mathematics, Data Science, and Computer Science. I'm passionate about building machine-learning solutions that tackle real-world challenges, from forecasting crypto markets to creating AI-powered tools for social impact.

I am an undergraduate researcher at the Berkeley Operations and Behavioral Analytics Lab (BOBALAB) in the Haas School of Business under Professor Park Sinchaisri, where I research how AI and behavioral economics intersect. I'm also exploring applications of NLP in financial markets and teaching computer architecture as an Academic Intern for CS 61C.

When I'm not coding, I'm grudgingly reliving high-school cross-country torture, perfecting cold-brew and matcha chemistry, and geeking out with my camera.

I also love reading Japanese mystery novels—especially Haruki Murakami's _The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle_ and _The Wild Sheep Chase_, and Keigo Higashino's _Journey Under the Midnight Sun_.

Feel free to connect at minggangli [at] berkeley [dot] edu.
