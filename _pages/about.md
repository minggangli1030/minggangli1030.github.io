# Hey, I’m Minggang (Martin) Li 👋

I’m a second-year at UC Berkeley, double majoring in Applied Math (Stats cluster) and Data Science (Econ emphasis), with a CS minor. I’m especially interested in applying machine learning to real-world problems.

You can reach me at minggangli [at] berkeley [dot] edu.
