Hi, I’m Minggang (pronounced “ming-gahng”; you can also call me Martin) Li — a UC Berkeley rising sophomore double-majoring in Applied Mathematics and Data Science, with a Computer Science minor. I’m passionate about building machine-learning solutions that tackle real-world challenges, from forecasting crypto markets to creating AI-powered tools for social impact. 

I am an undergraduate researcher at the Berkeley Operations and Behavioral Analytics Lab (BOBALAB) in the Haas School of Business under Professor Park Sinchaisri, where I assist in researching how AI and behavioral economics intersect.

When I’m not coding, I’m grudgingly reliving high-school cross-country torture, perfecting cold-brew and matcha chemistry, and geeking out with my camera. 

I also love reading Japanese mystery novels—especially Haruki Murakami (_The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle_; _The Wild Sheep Chase_) and Keigo Higashino (_Journey Under the Midnight Sun_).
